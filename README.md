# Guessing-game
A small number guessing game to demonstrate the basic and powerful features of Rust language ( From the rust book [Chapter-2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) )

The program takes a number as input and checks it against a randomly generated secret number to see whether the secret number matches the number generated by the user. Also based on the ordering the program also tells whether the number entered entered by user is smaller or greater than the randomly generated secret number
